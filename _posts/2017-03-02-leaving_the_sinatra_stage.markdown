I finished the Fwitter final project right before leaving town for a little while, and when I came back it was tough to get back into the final project - the mental image I had of the MVC setup had apparently also taken a bit of a trip. I definitely learned my lesson in that regard. 

The main advantage I see to developing sites in Sinatra is how easy it is to add additional functionality. I think the most fun part of this particular project was adding all the little bells and whistles at the end of the project, like back buttons and a search bar. Once the Ruby aspect of those was working, it was very easy to add a new method to the controller and put in the functionality I'd envisioned. I can see how it's Sinatra that makes that easy, and also how something so simple could be a big pain in a less agile framework. 

I appreciate that Sinatra lets you pick and choose what you want to include, and at the same time am looking forward to comparing that to Rails and the ways Rails provides more of the structure right from the start.
