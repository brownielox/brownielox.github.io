Even though the Kickstarter and the Music Player project are structurally similar to this one, this project still felt daunting at the beginning. I was frustrated by that fact - hadn't I already done this twice? But a codealong is an entirely different learning experience, and once I accepted that it was okay that the code wasn't just flowing out at first, I finally felt like I was making progress. 

The site I was working with was a challenge to parse for Nokogiri (the HTML frequently used "tab" to position items in the chart) but that ended up working to my advantage learning-wise. The fact that every cell was simply called "odd" meant that I had to keep track of more, and also taught me the importance of trying to make code easy to read for other developers. I think it's easy to think of code as simply needing to function, but now I feel differently. I think it's more like writing: that is, the purpose of writing is to communicate to future readers as best it can. Code should be like that too, and not merely something that does its job once it's running. 

This project reconfirmed for me the relationships between methods and the loops they're called in. The part I spent the most time on aside from parsing the HTML was that. I can comfortably see the relationship now when I look at code, but building it can still be a challenge, like when I kept returning the locations of the items instead of the items themselves.
