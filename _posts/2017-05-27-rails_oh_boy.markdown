Before Weird Al there was another Al: Allan Sherman. He wrote folk parodies throughout the sixties, and listening to his records is one of my favorite memories from growing up. He’s most famous for “Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah,” but he has another song called “Oh, Boy,” a parody of the Mexican folk song “Chiapanecas.” In Allan Sherman’s version a chorus calls out good and bad things (think itching scratches and paying taxes), and he answers with an “oh boy” that matches, tonally. 
 
Learning Rails is like “Oh Boy.” Some things are really great, and while building my flashcard project I was often struck by how powerful it was. Devise is an obvious example, but routes in general are a stellar tool once you know how to sort through them, and what is feeding what where, and when. But then, as we all know, routes are also a frustrated “oh boy.” Am I missing an “s”? Did I get the specified order wrong? Where did the last twenty minutes go?
 
I spent a bit of time trying to add a “next card” and a “previous card” method to a model, which, because of Rails magic, seeing why it was or wasn’t working could be opaque. But when I spontaneously decided to add a “random card” as an additional button, suddenly that was super smooth, also because of Rails. 
 
Throughout the process I took comfort in knowing is that everybody (or most everybody) seems to feel pretty similarly about Rails. Just like everybody likes itching scratches and nobody likes paying taxes, everyone that struggles through Rails experiences the love/hate cycle. 
 
Now it’s time for Javascript. Oh boy!
