Without realizing it, there were a few bells and whistles that I added to my Rails app that became far easier to create (and looked better) once I was using JavaScript. In that sense, I accidentally created a pretty good demo for the advantages of using JavaScript in addition to the Rails framework. I certainly see why the ability to update in place makes JS the backbone of the internet. I can also see where discreet URLs are useful too, and it seems to me that a developer simply learns the best way to incorporate both over time. Not everything can be a one page app, nor should it be. The Learn website would be tougher to navigate if every lesson didn't have its own route, as I often find I have several tabs of lessons open at once. But with my app, adding a new flashcard doesn't have to be a three-page ordeal. 

I also found myself considering the user's experience of my app more than before. Having to consider what will load at any given point naturally leads to trying to streamline the process, which is advantageous to both the developer and to the eventual user. It's not that I'd never considered it before, in fact, I enjoyed it. But having to think through the sequence of events that happens on any given page was a more interesting puzzle beyond which pages to connect to which.
