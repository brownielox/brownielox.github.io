When I was working on my Rails and Javascript final project, my main JS file ended up holding the majority of my code. At some point, I realized whenever I needed to find out anything I would scroll up and down. At first I added some comments to try and give myself some direction when I was searching through it to find and error or to refactor. Then I opted to print it out. Looking at it on paper helped me map in my brain where everything was located, even though I’d just been looking at the same code on screen. Things went much more quickly after that, and now when I’m feeling lost in the code I print it out instead. 

There was a [study](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/) (there were probably several) about how reading on a screen prevents readers from mapping as effectively in their minds. This doesn’t matter as much for shorter things, but I've found that, for me, longer code files are harder to map than an essay of a similar length. Comments only go so far for this for me, and it seems like writing things out certainly has its advantages. I guess that's why whiteboarding is popular!
